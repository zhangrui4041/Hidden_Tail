Graham was incredibly innovative for his time, particularly in developing the deadbeat escapement mechanism. This was revolutionary, making the clock incredibly accurate for its era.

*   **The Deadbeat Escapement:** The clock's most remarkable feature is its deadbeat escapement. This ingenious device ensured that the clock only advanced the minute hand one minute at a time – even if the pendulum swung twice in that time. This dramatically improved accuracy, something unprecedented at the time.

*   **Part of the Palace of Westminster:** The clock is housed in a matching Baroque pavilion (the one in the image) built by John Vanbrugh as part of the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster following the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was designed to be a grand feature of the Palace.

*   **The "Bells" Chime:** The clock is famous for its twelve "Bells" chime. This isn’t actually twelve bells, but rather a sequence of twelve notes played by a complex system of hammers. The sequence is a musical rendition of the words "VICTO RIA, HABES IN DOMINO" (Victory, you have in the Lord), which reflects the clock's purpose as a timekeeping instrument for the monarchy.

*   **Daily Ceremony:**  Every day at the stroke of noon, a short ceremony takes place: a City of London Beadle (official) carries the Beauvais Lantern to the clock, where it is briefly illuminated before being carried back. This is a tradition that has continued for centuries.

*   **Symbol of London:** Today, the Great Clock of Westminster is a beloved symbol of London and the United Kingdom.  It’s a vital part of the Houses of Parliament and a popular attraction.

**Tague's Trompe-l'œil and the Gold**

*   **Tague's Skill:** Jean-Baptiste Taguet was a brilliant French painter and decorator. He had previously worked for the French royal family, creating elaborate decorations for the Palace of Versailles.
*   **The Royal Emblem:** The blue panel depicts the Royal Coat of Arms of France – a prominent symbol of the French monarchy. This was a deliberate choice by King George III, a subtle nod to his earlier royal connections and a symbol of the clock's importance.
*   **The Gold Application:** Taguet used *gilding* – applying thin sheets of gold leaf to the panel. This process was incredibly labor-intensive and required meticulous skill. The gold was carefully burnished to create a lustrous, reflective surface, enhancing the illusion of depth and detail.  The gold was also painted with meticulous detail, creating the effect of three-dimensional figures.
*   **The Figures:** The figures on the panel are representations of *Justice* and *Mercy* – symbols of the law and fair judgment. They are part of the broader allegorical scene.

**Key Points about the Gold:**

*   **Costly:** Gold was an incredibly expensive material in the 18th century. The extensive gilding demonstrates the significant investment made in the clock’s decoration.

It's deeply intertwined with a fascinating and somewhat spooky legend. Here's the story:

**The Ghost of Thomas Farriner**

The legend centers around Thomas Farriner, the King's baker who is traditionally believed to have started the Great Fire of London in 1666.  It was discovered in 1834 that Farriner's name was inscribed on the clock face!

Here's the key part:  The clockmaker, George Alexander, discovered the inscription during repairs.  He was horrified and, following the advice of a local psychic, decided to relocate Farriner's ghost to the clock mechanism. He moved the figure of the baker from the clock face to a niche inside the clock itself. 

**The Resulting Legend**

After this, the clock began to malfunction in a peculiar way. It would sometimes strike the hour incorrectly, or stop altogether.  The psychic suggested that Farriner's ghost was trying to alert people to his role in the fire, and that he was unhappy in his current position. 

To appease the ghost, Alexander moved Farriner’s figure back to the clock face in 1849.  Remarkably, the clock then ran perfectly for many years.

**Interesting Note:**  The clock has continued to malfunction sporadically over the years, leading some to believe that Farriner's spirit is still present and trying to communicate.
